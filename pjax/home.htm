
<h1>I'am Pjax!</h1>

<p> pjax loads html from your server into the current page
    without a full page load. It's ajax with real permalinks,
    page titles, and a working back button that fully degrades. </p>
<p> Check the box to toggle pjax. </p>
<p> Whenever the time changes, a full page load has happened.
    If the time doesn't change,  no full page load has occurred. </p>
<p> The idea is you can't tell the difference between pjax
    page loads and normal page loads. On complicated sites,
    browsing just "feels faster." </p>
